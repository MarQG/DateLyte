						<p>With access to a million plus recipes, there isn’t a food allergy or taste bud that we can’t please. No matter the type of diet, food allergy or occasion we have both a search and filter system to allow you to find that perfect dish, no matter your skill level in the kitchen.</p> 
						
						
						<p>Meal planning is for the birds, that is unless you have an app that can add your new favorite recipe to the day of the week and desired time you choose. You can have breakfast for dinner and dinner for lunch, it's totally up to you. Find the recipe, add it to “My Week”, choose the time in which you’d like to eat and it is added to your weekly meal plan. You can sit down on a Saturday, plan your meals for the week, then head to the grocery store.</p> 
						
						
						<p>Who loves grocery shopping? Yeah, didn’t think so. Especially walking around with a pen and paper or even a notepad on your phone or tablet trying to figure out what you are going to cook, what you already have in the pantry or just what you need. So much fun! EatNeat sets out to make this experience seamless. You’ve found your recipes, created your meal plan and now you simply add those recipes to your grocery list. By recipe, you can go through your grocery list and cross out the things you already have before ever leaving home. Hopefully, you’ll love grocery shopping a little more.</p>
