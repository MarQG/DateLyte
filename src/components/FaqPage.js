									<h3>Will it work on my cellphone?</h3>
									<p>While the current iteration of EatNeat is a web application we have done everything we could to make sure you would have the same access and function via your favorite mobile device. Be on the lookout in the very near future for our mobile application!</p>

								<h3>Is there a pro version that includes grocery delivery?</h3>
								<p>There is no pro version yet. We are however working on a relationship that will allow grocery delivery and/or curbside service. It’s our intention to provide as much convenience as possible to make your life that much easier.</p>

									<h3>How do I remove a recipe from my favorites?</h3>
									<p>You can with a click remove a favorite. Sometimes it happens that the picture had you thinking one thing and the results had you thinking something totally different. So, we made it easy to send that recipe back to where it came from.</p>

									<h3>What if I accidentally remove a recipe?</h3>
									<p>Oh no!! Don’t worry, we got you. The most convenient thing we could think of was to keep a kung fu grip on your recent searches. Locate them and you will find that one that got away. Re-save her to your favorites and this time, don’t let her go.</p>

									<h3>How many favorites/Grocery List can a user have?</h3>
									<p>A plethora. A deluge. An overabundance. A profusion. Ok, I think you get it. You can create as many favorites as you like. Create your very own “recipe book”! Ideally I would think you’d only want a grocery list that pertains to what you’re cooking that week, but either way, feel free to get your list on.</p>
